# Exercise 4: Assume that we execute the following assignment statements:

width = 17
height = 12.0

# For each of the following expressions, write the value of the expression and the
# type (of the value of the expression).

print(width//2)
# 8, int

print(width/2.0)
# 8.5, float

print(height/3)
# 4.0, float

print(1 + 2 * 5)
# 11, int
