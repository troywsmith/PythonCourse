# Using Python to Access Web Data

### Chapter 11: Regular Expressions

brittle code: Code that works when the input data is in a particular format but is prone to breakage if there is some deviation from the correct format. We call this “brittle code” because it is easily broken.

greedy matching: The notion that the + and * characters in a regular expression expand outward to match the largest possible string.

grep: A command available in most Unix systems that searches through text files looking for lines that match regular expressions. The command name stands for “Generalized Regular Expression Parser”.

regular expression: A language for expressing more complex search strings. A regular expression may contain special characters that indicate that a search only matches at the beginning or end of a line or many other similar capabilities.

wild card: A special character that matches any character. In regular expressions the wild-card character is the period.

### Chapter 12: Network Technology

BeautifulSoup: A Python library for parsing HTML documents and extracting data from HTML documents that compensates for most of the imperfections in the HTML that browsers generally ignore. You can download the BeautifulSoup code from www.crummy.com.

port: A number that generally indicates which application you are contacting when you make a socket connection to a server. As an example, web traffic usually uses port 80 while email traffic uses port 25.

scrape: When a program pretends to be a web browser and retrieves a web page, then looks at the web page content. Often programs are following the links in one page to find the next page so they can traverse a network of pages or a social network.

socket: A network connection between two applications where the applications can send and receive data in either direction.

spider: The act of a web search engine retrieving a page and then all the pages linked from a page and so on until they have nearly all of the pages on the Internet which they use to build their search index.

### Chapter 13: Using Web Services 

API: Application Program Interface - A contract between applications that defines the patterns of interaction between two application components.

ElementTree: A built-in Python library used to parse XML data.

JSON: JavaScript Object Notation. A format that allows for the markup of structured data based on the syntax of JavaScript Objects.

SOA: Service-Oriented Architecture. When an application is made of components connected across a network.

XML: eXtensible Marku

### Chapter 14: Object-oriented programming
