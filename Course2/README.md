# Python Data Structures

### Chapter 6: Strings

counter: A variable used to count something, usually initialized to zero and then incremented.

empty string: A string with no characters and length 0, represented by two quotation marks.

format operator: An operator, %, that takes a format string and a tuple and generates a string that includes the elements of the tuple formatted as specified by the format string.

format sequence: A sequence of characters in a format string like %d, that specifies how a value should be formatted.

format string: A string, used with the format operator, that contains format sequences.

flag: A boolean variable used to indicate whether a condition is true or false.

invocation: A statement that calls a method.

immutable: The property of a sequence whose items cannot be assigned.

index: An integer value used to select an item in a sequence, such as a character in a string.

item: One of the values in a sequence. method A function that is associated with an object and called using dot notation.

object: Something a variable can refer to. For now, you can use “object” and
“value” interchangeably.

search: A pattern of traversal that stops when it finds what it is looking for.

sequence: An ordered set; that is, a set of values where each value is identified by an integer index.

slice: A part of a string specified by a range of indices.
traverse To iterate

### Chapter 7: Files

catch: To prevent an exception from terminating a program using the try and except statements.

newline: A special character used in files and strings to indicate the end of a line.

Pythonic: A technique that works elegantly in Python. “Using try and except is the Pythonic way to recover from missing files”.

Quality Assurance: A person or team focused on insuring the overall quality of a software product. QA is often involved in testing a product and identifying problems before the product is released.

text file: A sequence of characters stored in permanent storage like a hard drive.

### Chapter 8: Lists

aliasing: A circumstance where two or more variables refer to the same object.

delimiter: A character or string used to indicate where a string should be split.

element: One of the values in a list (or other sequence); also called items.

equivalent: Having the same value.

index: An integer value that indicates an element in a list.
identical Being the same object (which implies equivalence).

list: A sequence of values.

list traversal: The sequential accessing of each element in a list.

nested list: A list that is an element of another list.

object: Something a variable can refer to. An object has a type and a value.

reference: The association between a variable and its value.
