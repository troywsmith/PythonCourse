# Python Data Structures

### Chapter 6: Strings

counter: A variable used to count something, usually initialized to zero and then incremented.

empty string: A string with no characters and length 0, represented by two quotation marks.

format operator: An operator, %, that takes a format string and a tuple and generates a string that includes the elements of the tuple formatted as specified by the format string.

format sequence: A sequence of characters in a format string like %d, that specifies how a value should be formatted.

format string: A string, used with the format operator, that contains format sequences.

flag: A boolean variable used to indicate whether a condition is true or false.

invocation: A statement that calls a method.

immutable: The property of a sequence whose items cannot be assigned.

index: An integer value used to select an item in a sequence, such as a character in a string.

item: One of the values in a sequence. method A function that is associated with an object and called using dot notation.

object: Something a variable can refer to. For now, you can use “object” and
“value” interchangeably.

search: A pattern of traversal that stops when it finds what it is looking for.

sequence: An ordered set; that is, a set of values where each value is identified by an integer index.

slice: A part of a string specified by a range of indices.
traverse To iterate

### Chapter 7: Files

catch: To prevent an exception from terminating a program using the try and except statements.

newline: A special character used in files and strings to indicate the end of a line.

Pythonic: A technique that works elegantly in Python. “Using try and except is the Pythonic way to recover from missing files”.

Quality Assurance: A person or team focused on insuring the overall quality of a software product. QA is often involved in testing a product and identifying problems before the product is released.

text file: A sequence of characters stored in permanent storage like a hard drive.

### Chapter 8: Lists

aliasing: A circumstance where two or more variables refer to the same object.

delimiter: A character or string used to indicate where a string should be split.

element: One of the values in a list (or other sequence); also called items.

equivalent: Having the same value.

index: An integer value that indicates an element in a list.
identical Being the same object (which implies equivalence).

list: A sequence of values.

list traversal: The sequential accessing of each element in a list.

nested list: A list that is an element of another list.

object: Something a variable can refer to. An object has a type and a value.

reference: The association between a variable and its value.

### Chapter 9: Dictionaries

dictionary: A mapping from a set of keys to their corresponding values.

hashtable: The algorithm used to implement Python dictionaries.

hash function: A function used by a hashtable to compute the location for a key.

histogram: A set of counters.

implementation: A way of performing a computation.

item: Another name for a key-value pair.

key: An object that appears in a dictionary as the first part of a key-value pair.

key-value pair: The representation of the mapping from a key to a value.

lookup: A dictionary operation that takes a key and finds the corresponding value.

nested loops: When there are one or more loops “inside” of another loop. The inner loop runs to completion each time the outer loop runs once.

value: An object that appears in a dictionary as the second part of a key-value pair. This is more specific than our previous use of the word “value”.

### Chapter 10: Tuples

comparable: A type where one value can be checked to see if it is greater than, less than, or equal to another value of the same type. Types which are comparable can be put in a list and sorted.

data structure: A collection of related values, often organized in lists, dictionaries, tuples, etc.

DSU: Abbreviation of “decorate-sort-undecorate”, a pattern that involves building a list of tuples, sorting, and extracting part of the result.

gather: The operation of assembling a variable-length argument tuple.

hashable: A type that has a hash function. Immutable types like integers, floats, and strings are hashable; mutable types like lists and dictionaries are not.

scatter: The operation of treating a sequence as a list of arguments. 

shape (of a data structure): A summary of the type, size, and composition of a data structure.

singleton: A list (or other sequence) with a single element.

tuple: An immutable sequence of elements.

tuple assignment: An assignment with a sequence on the right side and a tuple of variables on the left. The right side is evaluated and then its elements are assigned to the variables on the left.
